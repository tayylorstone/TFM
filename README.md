This thesis compares ARIMA and UCSV models for inflation forecasting across G7 economies, with and without a Global Inflation Factor from 1990-2023. Using rolling-window forecasts and multiple accuracy tests, findings show global factors improve forecast accuracy by capturing shared shocks, while ARIMA models better handle country-specific trends.
